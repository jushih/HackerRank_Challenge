# HackerRank Challenge

I solved 3 coding challenges on HackerRank. Following the challenge, I refactored my code so that is cleaner and more efficient. The original submission and the refactored version can be found in the iPython Notebooks. I have also turned the refactored code into Python scripts that accept an input and returns the solution.
